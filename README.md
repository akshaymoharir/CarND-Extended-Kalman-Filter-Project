# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project I have utilized a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `

# Rubric points

## Compiling

### Your code should compile

The code compiles without errors.

## Accuracy

### px, py, vx, vy output coordinates must have an RMSE <= [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52] when using the file: "obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt" which is the same data file the simulator uses for Dataset 1.

The EKF accuracy was:

- Dataset 1 : RMSE <= [0.0973, 0.0855, 0.4513, 0.4399]
- Dataset 2 : RMSE <= [0.0726, 0.0965, 0.4216, 0.4932]

## Following the Correct Algorithm

### Your Sensor Fusion algorithm follows the general processing flow as taught in the preceding lessons.


The Kalman filter implementation can be found src/kalman_filter.cpp.

### Your Kalman Filter algorithm handles the first measurements appropriately.

The first measurement is handled in src/FusionEKF.cpp from line 61 to line 107.

### Your Kalman Filter algorithm first predicts then updates.

The predict operation could be found at src/FusionEKF.cpp line 147 and the update operation from line 159 to 169 of the same file.

### Your Kalman Filter can handle radar and lidar measurements.

Different type of measurements are handled in two places in src/FusionEKF.cpp:

- For the first measurement from line 61 to line 107.
- For the update part from line 159 to 169.

## Code Efficiency

### Your algorithm should avoid unnecessary calculations.

An example of this calculation optimization is when the Q matrix is calculated src/FusionEKF.cpp line 135 to line 144.
